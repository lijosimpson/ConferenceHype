# ASCO Hype

ASCO Hype is an AI-powered, reporter-style oncology conference coverage channel for ASCO 2026. It is built as a media/commentary product: it tracks official sources, reputable media, company updates, exhibitor activity, and monitored social posts, then routes generated segments through human review before anything airs.

## What This Is

- A Next.js 15 public channel and protected operator dashboard.
- A review-gated editorial workflow for AI-generated conference commentary.
- A monitored hashtag and bot mention loop: `#ASCOHype`, `#AskASCOHype`, and `@ASCOHypeAI`.
- A low-cost deployment shape: Vercel for the app, Supabase for data/auth/storage, GitHub Actions for scheduled jobs, and a small stream worker for FFmpeg/YouTube.

## What This Is Not

ASCO Hype is not medical advice, clinical advice, scientific validation, legal advice, or financial advice. Every segment must include:

> ASCO Hype is AI-generated conference commentary for informational and entertainment purposes only. It is not medical, clinical, scientific, legal, or financial advice. Always consult qualified professionals and primary sources.

## Local Setup

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

- Public channel: `http://localhost:3000`
- Operator dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

The app runs in mock mode without credentials. Add `.env.local` values when you are ready to connect real services.

## Production Setup

Use [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md) as the step-by-step operator checklist.

### 1. GitHub

Create a GitHub repo and push this project.

Add repository secrets:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `LLM_API_KEY`
- `LLM_BASE_URL`
- `LLM_MODEL`
- `X_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`
- `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`

GitHub Actions:

- `Ingest sources`: runs every 30 minutes.
- `Generate review segments`: runs hourly.
- `Render media`: manual until media storage and worker deployment are finalized.

### 2. Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Run `supabase/seed.sql`.
4. Enable email auth for admin users.
5. Create private storage buckets for rendered segments and clips.
6. Copy URL, anon key, and service role key into GitHub and Vercel secrets.

### 3. Vercel

1. Import the GitHub repo.
2. Add the values from `.env.example`.
3. Deploy from `main`.
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` when the live stream is created.
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_HLS_URL` when the fallback playlist is available.

### 4. YouTube

1. Verify the YouTube channel.
2. Enable live streaming at least 24 hours before launch.
3. Create a scheduled ASCO Hype live event.
4. Store the RTMP URL and stream key as secrets.
5. Rehearse with an unlisted stream before the public launch.

### 5. ElevenLabs or TTS Provider

1. Use a plan/license that allows your intended publishing and commercial use.
2. Pick one voice per persona.
3. Add voice IDs to the `VOICE_*` environment variables.

## Source Policy

Priority order:

1. Official ASCO agenda and abstracts.
2. Reputable oncology and medical media.
3. Company and exhibitor statements.
4. Verified or high-credibility social accounts.
5. General social posts, hashtags, and bot mentions.

Social posts are always labeled as social buzz unless confirmed by stronger sources.

## Hashtag and Bot Mention Flow

Ask users to post with:

- `#ASCOHype`
- `#AskASCOHype`
- `@ASCOHypeAI`

The X ingestion job searches those terms, creates `social_signal` source items, and sends generated commentary to the human review queue. Operators must approve or edit scripts before airing.

## Useful Commands

```powershell
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run job:ingest
npm run job:generate
npm run job:render
```

Streaming worker:

```powershell
npm run job:stream
```

That command expects `ffmpeg`, `STREAM_INPUT_PATH`, `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`, and `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`.

## Launch Checklist

- Confirm Supabase schema and admin login.
- Confirm RSS ingestion works.
- Confirm X hashtag ingestion works.
- Confirm generated scripts include citations and disclaimer.
- Confirm social posts are labeled as buzz.
- Confirm market segments contain no buy/sell/hold recommendations.
- Confirm approval is required before public queue visibility.
- Add licensed music to `public/music/light-jazz-techno.mp3`.
- Render one full segment with voice, music bed, captions, and disclaimer.
- Generate one 30-60 second clip from an approved segment.
- Run a 2-hour unlisted YouTube rehearsal.
- Test emergency override.
- Test fallback HLS playlist.
- Confirm final public stream embed in Vercel.

## Current MVP Notes

The code intentionally supports mock mode so the app is runnable before credentials are configured. The next production hardening step is replacing the mock data reads/writes in `lib/data.ts` and admin API routes with Supabase table operations.
