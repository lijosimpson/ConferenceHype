# ASCO Hype

ASCO Hype is an AI-powered, reporter-style oncology conference coverage channel for ASCO 2026. It is built as a media/commentary product: it tracks official sources, reputable media, company updates, exhibitor activity, and monitored social posts, then routes generated segments through human review before anything airs.

## What This Is

- A Next.js 15 public channel and protected operator dashboard.
- A review-gated editorial workflow for AI-generated conference commentary.
- A monitored hashtag, bot mention, X voice loop, and Instagram push-prep loop: `#ASCOHype`, `#AskASCOHype`, `#ASCO26`, `@ASCOHypeAI`, `@ConferenceHype`, plus reviewed posts from watched X voices such as `@ASCO`, `@ASCOPost`, `@OncLive`, and `@statnews`.
- A low-cost deployment shape: Vercel for the app, Supabase for data/auth/storage, GitHub Actions for scheduled jobs, and a small stream worker for FFmpeg/YouTube.

## What This Is Not

ASCO Hype is not medical advice, clinical advice, scientific validation, legal advice, or financial advice. Every segment must include:

> ASCO Hype is AI-generated conference commentary for informational and entertainment purposes only. It is not medical, clinical, scientific, legal, or financial advice. Always consult qualified professionals and primary sources.

## Local Setup

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

- Public channel: `http://localhost:3000`
- Operator dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

The app runs in mock mode without credentials. Add `.env.local` values when you are ready to connect real services.

## Production Setup

Use [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](./LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md) as the step-by-step operator checklist.
Use [LOW_BANDWIDTH.md](./LOW_BANDWIDTH.md) for the conference-bandwidth operating rule.

### 1. GitHub

Create a GitHub repo and push this project.

Add repository secrets:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `LLM_API_KEY`
- `LLM_BASE_URL`
- `LLM_MODEL`
- `X_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`
- `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`

GitHub Actions:

- `Ingest sources`: runs every 30 minutes.
- `Generate ASCO upcoming-events spine`: runs every 20 minutes and creates the main no-token schedule segment from the preprocessed ASCO schedule and abstract index.
- `Generate ASCO 75-minute recap briefing`: runs every 75 minutes and creates the short "what happened / what is next" agenda segment from the preprocessed ASCO schedule and abstract index.
- `Generate review segments`: runs hourly for media, social, exhibitor, and background programming.
- `Render media`: manual until media storage and worker deployment are finalized.

## ASCO 2026 Batch Backbone

The recurring schedule desk is intentionally no-token for the main broadcast spine. The local ASCO schedule workbook and abstracts CSV are preprocessed into `data/asco2026/core-index.json`. The upcoming-events job creates a prepared segment every 20 minutes without an LLM call:

- next 20 minutes: sessions attendees may want to catch next
- a small number of matching abstract records for context
- deterministic copy that is safe to run as the main daily broadcast spine

The 75-minute recap job is a separate, broader desk segment:

- last 75 minutes: sessions that just wrapped
- next 60 minutes: larger forward look
- can use the configured LLM for a more natural recap script

Run locally:

```powershell
npm run job:upcoming
npm run job:briefing
```

For a local smoke test outside the live ASCO dates:

```powershell
$env:ASCO_UPCOMING_NOW="2026-05-29T12:55:00-05:00"; npm run job:upcoming
$env:ASCO_BRIEFING_NOW="2026-05-29T14:30:00-05:00"; npm run job:briefing
```

The raw source files should stay local/operator-controlled. Do not paste whole workbooks, full abstract exports, or full article bodies into prompts.

Programming rule:

- The 20-minute upcoming-events spine is the core broadcast every day.
- Social posts, `#ASCOHype`, X, Instagram-style posts, OncLive, STAT News, The ASCO Post, and exhibitor/company updates interrupt that spine only as reviewed media/social segments.
- Instagram is treated as an operator/manual social watchlist and caption/reel prep path by default unless a compliant provider/API is added later.
- Every 3 hours, the generation job can create a review-gated "social voice competition" segment that ranks leading watched X/social voices like a scoreboard. This is hype/topic discovery only, not source verification.

### 2. Supabase

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Run `supabase/seed.sql`.
4. Enable email auth for admin users.
5. Create private storage buckets for rendered segments and clips.
6. Copy URL, anon key, and service role key into GitHub and Vercel secrets.

### 3. Vercel

1. Import the GitHub repo.
2. Add the values from `.env.example`.
3. Deploy from `main`.
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDIO_STREAM_URL` for the lowest-bandwidth public player.
5. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_HLS_URL` when the low-bitrate fallback playlist is available.
6. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` when the YouTube stream is created.

### 4. YouTube

1. Verify the YouTube channel.
2. Enable live streaming at least 24 hours before launch.
3. Create a scheduled ASCO Hype live event.
4. Store the RTMP URL and stream key as secrets.
5. Rehearse with an unlisted stream before the public launch.

### 5. ElevenLabs or TTS Provider

1. Use a plan/license that allows your intended publishing and commercial use.
2. Pick one voice per persona.
3. Add voice IDs to the `VOICE_*` environment variables.

## Source Policy

Priority order:

1. Official ASCO agenda and abstracts.
2. Reputable oncology and medical media.
3. Company and exhibitor statements.
4. Verified or high-credibility social accounts.
5. General social posts, hashtags, and bot mentions.

Social posts are always labeled as social buzz unless confirmed by stronger sources.

## Hashtag and Bot Mention Flow

Ask users to post with:

- `#ASCOHype`
- `#AskASCOHype`
- `#ASCO26`
- `@ASCOHypeAI`
- `@ConferenceHype`

Listeners can tag `@ConferenceHype` with steps, walks, runs, gym sessions, and other workouts during the meeting day. These posts are reviewed as audience shoutout candidates for the end-of-day broadcast, not as medical or fitness advice.
- watched X voices: `@ASCO`, `@ASCOPost`, `@OncLive`, `@statnews`

The X ingestion job searches those terms, creates `social_signal` source items, and sends generated commentary to the human review queue. Operators must approve or edit scripts before airing.

Operators can add more X accounts from the admin **X voices to call out** panel. Added follows are stored as enabled social sources and included in the X recent-search query when Supabase and `X_BEARER_TOKEN` are configured.

Instagram posts, reels, and caption ideas can be pasted into the admin Instagram panel. They are treated as manual social signals, generate review-gated commentary, and can use the caption starter for outward posts asking viewers to tag `#ASCOHype`, `#ASCO26`, and `@ConferenceHype`.

The admin **Social voice competition** panel shows the current scoreboard and whether the 3-hour competition segment is due in the current generation block.

## Useful Commands

```powershell
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run job:ingest
npm run job:generate
npm run job:briefing
npm run job:upcoming
npm run job:render
```

Streaming worker:

```powershell
npm run job:stream
```

That command expects `ffmpeg`, `STREAM_INPUT_PATH`, `YOUTUBE_RTMP_URL`, and `YOUTUBE_STREAM_KEY`.

## Launch Checklist

- Confirm Supabase schema and admin login.
- Confirm RSS ingestion works.
- Confirm X hashtag ingestion works.
- Confirm Instagram manual intake and caption prep works.
- Confirm generated scripts include citations and disclaimer.
- Confirm social posts are labeled as buzz.
- Confirm market segments contain no buy/sell/hold recommendations.
- Confirm approval is required before public queue visibility.
- Add licensed music to `public/music/light-jazz-techno.mp3`.
- Render one full segment with voice, music bed, captions, and disclaimer.
- Generate one 30-60 second clip from an approved segment.
- Run a 2-hour unlisted YouTube rehearsal.
- Test emergency override.
- Test fallback HLS playlist.
- Confirm final public stream embed in Vercel.

## Current MVP Notes

The code intentionally supports mock mode so the app is runnable before credentials are configured. The next production hardening step is replacing the mock data reads/writes in `lib/data.ts` and admin API routes with Supabase table operations.
